Elephants are capable swimmers and they can hold their breath and submerge completely. They benefit from the cool water on a hot day and they frequently bath and splash when they get the chance  grooming and cleaning themselves. Elephants have complex social structure in their herds and they form strong attachments to other elephants that last many years. Capable of long memory  complex understanding  and emotional attachment  they are far more like humans than we once realized. Yet  elephants have been kept in zoos and on farms  exploited for amusement  labor  and financial gain. Under increasing pressure from concerned groups  governments are now outlawing such practices and making it harder to take advantage of these wonderful animals. People are now understanding that elephant rides and zoos are inhumane for such large animals. Sanctuaries and rehabilitation facilities are becoming more common and tourism is favoring facilities with ample room for them and proper conditions. Seeing elephants in a setting like this will take ones breath away.

Perhaps this in-your-face display of kidneys gone wild will at least encourage designers in Munich to think twice before traveling further down this road.
